        <p style="clear: both;margin-left: 12%;margin-right: 9%;padding-top: 4%;">A computer is a machine that can be programmed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically. Modern computers can perform generic sets of operations known as programs. These programs enable computers to perform a wide range of tasks. A computer system is a "complete" computer that includes the hardware, operating system (main software), and peripheral equipment needed and used for "full" operation. This term may also refer to a group of computers that are linked and function together, such as a computer network or computer cluster. Early computers were only meant to be used for calculations.

        <p style="clear: both;margin-left: 11%;margin-right: 10%;padding-top: 4%;">The history of mobile phones covers mobile communication devices that connect wirelessly to the public switched telephone network. While the transmission of speech by signal has a long history, the first devices that were wireless, mobile, and also capable of connecting to the standard telephone network are much more recent. The first such devices were barely portable compared to today's compact hand-held devices, and their use was clumsy. Drastic changes have taken place in both the networking of wireless communication and the prevalence of its use, with smartphones becoming common globally and get used by almost majority of people. </p>
